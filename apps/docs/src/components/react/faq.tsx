        <AccordionTrigger>How is Phase free?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          The bot is hosted on {railwayLink}, which has a very generous Hobby
          tier, so keeping it free is as simple as keeping it cheap to run. The
          code is optimised for running on low resources, so it doesn't cost
          much.

          Right now, no, but very soon. Once it's ready, there'll be detailed
          guides on how to self-host.
