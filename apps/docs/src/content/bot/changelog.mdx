## June 2025 - v3.29 release

This aims to be the final minor update for Phase v3, with only bug patches from
here on out. Phase v4 will be the focus of development going forward, and a new
code branch will be created for it. Stay tuned for details regarding planned
features and other specifics.

_There are no new features in this release, but numerous bug fixes,
improvements, and finalisations have been made to ensure the bot is as stable as
possible! ü§ç_

### Bot stuff

- Sped up image rendering for all cards.
- Switched to lazy-loading for font file imports.
- Updated the look of `/level leaderboard` slightly.

  it.

## October 2024 - v3.27 release

This release focuses mainly on internal updates as we prepare for the upcoming
Phase v4.0.0 release. However, here are a few notable additions and changes:

- **New music command:** The `/music panel` command sends an interactive control
  panel that combines all of the other music commands into one. Existing music
  commands remain available as usual. Huge thanks to `@vantedev` for helping me
  out with this.

- **Framework improvements:** Major updates to the bot‚Äôs underlying framework
  improve speed, resource usage, error handling, and developer experience.

- **Audit Logs update:** The invite tracker has been redesigned and isolated
  within the codebase, in preparation for its eventual transition to a
  standalone module.

- **Codebase cleanup:** Lots of small changes here and there to clean up the
  codebase.

There's a lot to come in the following weeks and months, so stay tuned! ü§ç

## October 2024 - v3.26 release

Server selection now has its own dedicated page in the dashboard to make server
switching easier. With this change came an update to the dashboard's routing
system, so `/dashboard/modules` is now `/dashboard/guilds/[id]/modules`. This
allows for opening multiple dashboards in separate tabs, making it simpler to
copy configurations between servers.

## October 2024 - v3.25 release

This update focuses on improving the **Join to Create** module.

- New JTC channels now come with a management panel, so you can easily edit the
  name, lock the channel, mute members, and more!
- JTC channels will now be deleted as soon as the owner leaves, instead of once
  the channel is empty.
- Any JTC channel older than 24 hours will be automatically deleted.
- Finally, the bug preventing empty JTC channels from being cleaned up has been
  squashed!

## October 2024 - v3.24 release

- Added a new `/diceroll` command.
- Added new catfacts and compliments to their respective commands.
- Refactored the way the bot displays random images (`/cat`, `/duck`, etc)
- Fixed a bug with level-up roles that prevented server admins from ranking up.
- After a day-long outage, **music is now back online**!

## October 2024 - v3.23 release

This update mainly focuses on tweaking some of the dashboard UI to make it more
intuitive and easier to use.

### Dashboard Updates

- All role and channel select menus now have a search bar.
- The 'Manage Mode' button has been replaced with a simpler 'Add Module' button.
- Module cards now have better styles for hover/error/change states.

- The sidebar now has a few more links.

### Other Stuff

More commands for these groups are coming soon! ü§ç

- Moved existing games to the `/game` command group.

## September 2024 - v3.20 release

  [docs](https://phasebot.xyz/docs/modules/counters#variables)).
- Added a new `/config toggle` command to toggle modules.

- Fixed a regression where Twitch notifications were being sent multiple times.
- Fixed a regression where the emoji in `/giveaway create` was being rendered
  incorrectly.

## September 2024 - v3.19 release

Introducing the **Self Roles** module!

Self Roles let you create messages across your server that can be used by
members to add and remove roles. Each message can have up to 20 methods of 3
different types - reactions, buttons, and dropdown menus. Unlike Reaction Roles,
you can specify up to 20 roles to add **and** remove per
reaction/button/dropdown-option.

Currently, the module is available under the `Beta` tag on the dashboard as some
message options (namely custom dropdown placeholders and support for disabling
multiselect) are not yet implemented. As always, if you come across a bug let me
know and I'll have it fixed in the next release.

## September 2024 - v3.18 release

- Added support for adding songs from YouTube playlists with `/music add`.
- Improved music playback speed and quality, reducing buffering.
- Commands now execute ~39% faster due to better caching.

## September 2024 - v3.17 release

Audit logs are actually good now !!

- Recoded from the ground up with speed and maintainability in mind.
- A new highly-detailed formatting standard for all audit log messages.
- Full event parity with Discord's native audit logs (and beyond).

## September 2024 - v3.16 release

TL;DR: Updates for forms, auto roles, and the dashboard.

### Forms Update

The forms module now creates "form threads" (similar to tickets) that keep
everything within your server, instead of in members' DMs.

It also supports a wider range of input types: strings, numbers, and booleans,
along with input methods like modals, dropdowns, and buttons. Strings and
numbers use modals, dropdowns allow for selecting from multiple options, and
buttons are used for yes/no questions. You can also now let members skip
questions you deem optional.

Lastly, you can now accept or reject form submissions with a reason, using a
modal popup.

### Auto Roles Update

You can now pick which auto roles are assigned to which types of users (bots,
members, and everyone). Thanks to `@yousif.adel` for suggesting this! ü§ç

### Dashboard Update

Only the modules you have enabled will be visible by default; all others are
accessible through the "Manage Mode" button. Additionally, the save function for
module updates has been moved from individual module configs to the main page.
Modules with unsaved changes or errors will be highlighted for easy
identification.

## August 2024 - v3.15 release

- Added support for all kinds of pings (not just roles) in auto messages and
  bump reminders.

- Refactored the way the database stores information for reminders.

- Improved the efficiency and performance of database calls for reminders, bump
  reminders, auto messages, and join-to-creates.

- Fixed a bug that caused some join-to-create channels to not be deleted once
  everybody had left.

- Added better error catching and logging for join-to-creates (so the issue
  above doesn't happen again).

- Made some small stylistic changes to the look of `/level rank` cards.

## August 2024 - v3.14 release

- All dashboard multiline input boxes now support rich text (**this** _sort_

  <u>of</u> ~~thing~~), as well as Discord-specific stuff like `@` mentions and
  `#` channel shortcuts. Support for guild emojis via `:this:` is coming soon as
  well.

- We can now dynamically set the status of the bot, letting you know about
  outages or downtime without the need to be in our Discord server!

- Patched the issue that caused Twitch Notification spam.

- Updated the database caching mechanism to include even more stuff (makes bot
  speedier).

## August 2024 - v3.13 release

- Huge update for the Twitch Notifications module!!! You can now pick up to **5
  streamers** to get notifications for (previously just 1). Plus, I've added
  `@everyone` and `@here` mention options for those alerts (which is coming to
  other modules soon).

- The `/whois` command is now two separate commands: `/whois user` and
  `/whois member`. The key difference being `/whois user` will still give you
  basic info on a user even if they're not in the server where you run the
  command.

- The majority of database operations are now properly indexed and cached,
  meaning much faster bot responses and less strain on the database.

- There's now a link to the dashboard login page in the header of the site.

- Lots of little bug fixes and tiny improvements here and there as always.

## August 2024 - v3.12 release

**Music is here!!!** Here are the commands:

- `/music add` - Adds a song to the queue.
- `/music remove` - Removes a song from the queue.
- `/music pause` - Pauses the currently playing song.
- `/music resume` - Resumes the currently paused song.
- `/music queue` - Lists the songs in the queue.
- `/music stop` - Clears all songs from the queue.
- `/music skip` - Skips the current song.
- `/music seek` - Seeks to a specific time in the current song.
- `/music shuffle` - Shuffles the songs in the queue.
- `/music repeat` - Sets the repeat mode of the song or queue.
- `/music volume` - Sets the volume of the music.
- `/music filter` - Sets the filter of the music.

Only YouTube is supported at the moment, but I'm working on adding support for
other sources like Soundcloud and Apple Music. All video types will work,
including live streams.

If you find any bugs, let me know using the `/bot report` command and I'll fix
them as soon as I can.

## August 2024 - v3.11 release

- Added a new **Counters** module.
- Added a new `/weather` command.
- Redesigned the `/level rank` card (try it, its pretty).

  outside of categories wouldn't be selectable.

## July 2024 - v3.10 release

- Released `phasebot` v0.6.0 (which the bot now runs on).

Big updates coming soon! ü§ç

## July 2024 - v3.9 release

- Created the [Bug Report Form] for reporting bugs via the site.

## July 2024 - v3.8 release

- Rewrote the `/tictactoe` command to be speedier.
- Removed the `/poll` command since Discord added it natively.
- Removed some old unneccesary database code.
- Rewrote Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

> Note: A hotfix was required around an hour after the release of v3.8, which
> fixed an issue with the bot sometimes attempting to run commands in channels
> it doesn't have access to.

## July 2024 - v3.7 release

This release focuses on improving the dashboard load times and login processes.

- From now on, all authentication data is encrypted and then stored within a
  secure browser cookie, instead of in our database. Since we don't need to go
  back and forth between the database and the browser, this will make the
  dashboard load a lot faster.
- Login sessions now last for 7 days (was previously 24 hours).
- You can once again login to the dashboard via Discord OAuth2. This time, since
  the switch to relying on cookies, access/refresh tokens are only used once to
  verify your identity and create your cookie, then immediately revoked
  afterwards.
- There's a new pretty loading spinner :3

With the new login process, I'll be updating the privacy policy in the next day
or so to reflect the changes.

## July 2024 - v3.6 release

- Changed the `/nuke` command name to `/scrub`.
